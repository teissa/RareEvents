Corresponding behavioral dataset will be made available on the Open Science Framework under preregistration site 10.17605/OSF.IO/J9XET at time of manuscripte acceptance. 

Functions ending in "Model" create responses using the specified model type. Functions ending in "Fit" perform model fitting for a particular model. Bayesian models require an informed prior based on pilot studies (provided as informedPrior). Observations and trail structure can be built using the "syntheticDataGenerator"
